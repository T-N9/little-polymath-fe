          Little Polymath FE utilizes a collection of previously administered
          exam questions from the ITPEC organization to provide users with
          valuable practice opportunities for the ITPEC FE (Fundamental IT
          Engineer examination). It's important to note that Little Polymath FE
          does not own the data or hold any official affiliation or endorsement
          from the ITPEC organization.

          Our application is designed solely to support individuals in their
          preparation for the ITPEC FE exam by offering a platform for
          practicing with authentic questions. At Little Polymath FE, we are
          committed to creating a comprehensive learning experience to help
          users enhance their IT knowledge and skills. By practicing with the
          authentic questions used in previous ITPEC exams, users can
          familiarize themselves with the exam format and gain valuable insights
          into the subject matter. It is crucial to understand that while our
          app offers a robust learning tool, we are not involved in the exam
          administration or the creation of new questions. <br /><br /> We believe
          that practice is key to success, and our goal is to provide a valuable
          resource for aspiring IT professionals preparing for the ITPEC FE
          exam. We strive to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the
          questions included in our app, ensuring a reliable platform for exam
